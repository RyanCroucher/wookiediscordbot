A personal discord bot used on a couple of servers that I frequent with my friends.

Has chat-command functions to:

Store and retrieve funny quotes.
Simulate new quotes using markov chains.
Record and retrieve custom Dungeons and Dragons information such as:
	NPC records
	Deity records
	Combat statistics records
Roll dice.
Scrape wookieepedia for information on a given topic.
And more!
